    <h1>Officeroo - Privacy Policy</h1>
    </br>
    <h3>What kinds of information do we collect?</h3>
    <p>In order to provide the Service, we have to process information about you.</p>
    <p><u>Information you provide</u></p>
    <p>The information we collect includes your personal information when you sign up for an account and your match information when you submit or approve a score. We collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First and Last name for display purposes</li>
      <li>Business Email for authentication and communication purposes</li>
      <li>Match data for ranking purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Device Information</u></p>
    <p>We do not collect any information about your device, your browser, your location or your IP address. We do not track usage patterns besides aggregated total number of page views.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>How do we use this information?</h3>
    <p>Depending on the choices you make, we use the information we have to provide the Officeroo service. Here's how:</p>
    <p><u>Provide and improve our service</u></p>
    <p>We use the information we have to deliver our service. This includes the Rankings, the History and the Statistics page. We also use the information we have to create insights that allow us to improve our service and to provide better user experience through enhanced statistics delivered directly to you.</p>
    <p><u>Communicate with you</u></p>
    <p>We use the information we have to send you the roulette communications and let you know about any changes in our Privacy Policies. </p>
    </br>
    <h3>How is this information shared?</h3>
    <p>In order to provide our Service, we need to share some of your information with various parties. Here are the details:</p>
    <p><u>Registered users in your office</u></p>
    <p>Other registered users in your office can view some information about you: a limited match history, your statistics and your ranking. In the roulette emails, we share your name and email address with your roulette partner, to facilitate getting in contact with each other.</p>
    <p><u>Your office admin</u></p>
    <p>As mentioned above, your office admin does not have access to individual level data. Office admins are allowed to sign up as a user, which gives them the viewing rights of a normal registered user, as outlined above. </p>
    <p><u>Registered users or admins not in your office</u></p>
    <p>Users or admins that are registered but are not registered for your office, have no access to any of your data.</p>
    <p><u>Non-registered users</u></p>
    <p>Non-registered users who have the link to the app have view access to the data displayed in the app.</p>
    <p><u>3rd-Party business</u></p>
    <p>We do not share or sell any of your data to any 3rd party business.</p>
    <p><u>New owner</u></p>
    <p>If the ownership or control of the Officeroo service changes, we may transfer your data to the new owner.</p>
    <p><u>The Officeroo team</u></p>
    <p>In order to provide and maintain the service we provide, the Officeroo team has access to your personal data and match information. We are fully committed to treat your data with care and only share it with the parties outlined in this section.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>What about data retention, profile deactivation and profile deletion?</h3>
    <p>Your data is stored until we no longer need it to provide the Officeroo services, or until your account is permanently deleted - whichever happens first. </p>
    <p>When you permanently delete your account, we permanently erase the data that constitutes your profile from our databases. The history of the matches you have played is kept however, as that is not part of your profile. To permanently delete your profile, email us at <u>support@officeroo.io</u> with your requests and we will do it for you.</p>
    <p>If you only wish to temporarily deactivate your profile or unsubscribe for the weekly mailing, email us at <u>support@officeroo.io</u> with your requests and we will do it for you.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>With GDPR in place, how can you exercise your rights provided under this new regulation?</h3>
    <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Email us your requests at <u>support@officeroo.io</u> and we will do it for you within 24 hours.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>How to contact Officeroo with questions?</h3>
    <p>If have further questions related to these policies or the privacy of your data with Officeroo, please reach out to us at <u>support@officeroo.io</u>.</p>
